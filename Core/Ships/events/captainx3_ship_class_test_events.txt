# This listing is of each ID and what it does for ease of reference in-game:
# Type into the Console: event [eventname]. Below are all event names and their purpose.
#
# nsc_test.1  = Gives all technology for all ship/station classes
# nsc_test.2  = Gives all technology for all ship/station classes & gives one tech per reserachable weaponry type (PD/T/XL)
# nsc_test.3  = Gives Spaceport Levels 2-13
# nsc_test.4  = Gives Military Station technology (3 Vanilla, Battle Fortress, HQ Station)
# nsc_test.5  = Gives NSC stations non-military (Sensor/Mining/Power Stations)
# nsc_test.6 = Gives Science/Construction Cruiser
# nsc_test.7 = Gives 1 of each researchable weapon type (PD/T/XL)
# nsc_test.8 = Gives PD Weapon Type
# nsc_test.9 = Gives T Weapon Type
# nsc_test.10 = Gives XL Weapon Type
# nsc_test.11 = Gives Frontier Outpost Tier Techs
